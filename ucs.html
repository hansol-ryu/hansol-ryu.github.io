The prototype connects communication channels that were shattered, which caused inconvenience in keeping track of inventory of multiple shops. </p></div>

        <div class="content-dsc" id="challenge-dsc"><p>Anna, the shop manager of three souvenir shops of Botaniska Tradgarden in Uppsala, is in charge of /keeps keeping track of inventory and placing orders.</br></br>

Due to the absence of the central system specialized in shop management, she was in trouble for not being able to keep track of different shops at once. To update the inventory data gained by dropping by each shop or being reported by staff in each shop, she struggles with synchronizing the updated data with the existing system of the museum that was not specialized for shop management.</br></br>

Also, to have all data of three shops under her control, she used four shattered multiple channels apart from relying on her memory - an extremely cumbersome experience.

          <p>To fully understand her problems, we conducted <b>a 40 min-preliminary interview</b><em> at the common area in her office</em> and <b>an hour of contextual inquiry interview</b> <em>at the warehouse</em> where she actually does her inventory work.
One of my teammates and I walked through her work process from gaining data to updating on the existing system. We observed her work flow in detail and understood at which step of the work process she struggles the most by asking questions. We jotted down what we had observed and interviewed, and shared the result with the rest of teammates.

        <p>Later on, we analyzed the result using three work models.
  <br>-&nbsp;<b>Sequence model</b> : we analyzed the sequence of her work process along with dividing the process into several chunks depending on the intention of action. This process also revealed the break points of her work process, in which she is likely to experience inconvenience the most. Her work mainly consists of three process ; extracting the existing data, collecting new data, combining existing data and new data.
<br>-&nbsp;<b>Flow model</b> : We analyzed how the resources and communication flow between stakeholders. Mainly the shop staff and the shop manager communicate to keep each other updated.
<br>-&nbsp;<b>Artifact model</b> : We analyzed what and how artifacts are used around the work process. The artifacts include the channel for communication between employees(email, call), document processor software(Word, Excel, Google spreadsheet), and Blå Boken, a software system for the whole museum.

  <p>Other than solutions described above, we also came up with designs for placing order within the system. We presented our initial ideas to the shop manager, and according to the feedback, we removed the feature since it is not necessary for the manager to place an order within the system since she directly goes to the suppliers’ website. </p>

<!-- Reflection -->
  <div id="reflection">
    <div class="content-title"><strong>LEARNING OUTCOME</strong></div>
    <div class="content-dsc" id="rft-dsc"><p>The main takeaway from this project was how important it is to be in the real environment of the target task to understand the user and problems well. By observing the work process and asking questions in the real-setting(warehouse) , we could get much richer data at the warehouse than we did from the preliminary interview that took place at the office sitting at the table. That is because real-setting naturally reminds her of what she struggles with the most and shows all details of her work.<br><br>

Also, through the feedback we got during the iteration, I learned that what I think the user would need can be different from what the user actually needs. Some features that we came up with seem to be helpful to her but they were actually not. To provide the product that actually meets the user’s needs, asking and getting the feedback instead of assuming based on a preconceived idea was the key in this project.
